Hello Hello How are you now ?
Where are you now ?



As others have pointed out the $x are capture variables for regular expressions allowing you to reference sections of a matched pattern.

Perl also supports named captures which might be easier for humans to remember in some cases.

given input: 111 222

/(\d+)\s+(\d+)/

$1 is 111

$2 is 222

One could also say:

/(?<myvara>\d+)\s+(?<myvarb>\d+)/

$+{myvara} is 111

$+{myvarb} is 222
